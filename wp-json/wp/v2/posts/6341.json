You know this from the Christmas tree displays at the big-box retail outlets. So, if they&#8217;re preparing for these 60 days starting on November 1st, then you must do so as well. Here are some helpful tips to prepare your small business for the holidays.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bring in Seasonal Workers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You can&#8217;t do everything in your organization. Especially when sales have the potential of increasing during the holiday season. This is the reason you need to hire temporary help.<\/p>\n<p>However, selecting random people because they&#8217;re alive is a mistake. Holiday workers need the same vetting as you would give a candidate for a full-time position. Actually, they need to meet stronger requirements. They need to do the heavy lifting during the height of the holiday season.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Take Care of Tasks You&#8217;ve Put Off<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a good chance you have several items to address on your to-do list. It&#8217;s highly recommended to take care of them now. You won&#8217;t have the time or energy to address them as the holidays rev up.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, complete the changes to your website that you&#8217;ve put off for months. Stabilize your technology infrastructure&#8217;s storage capacity and security to reduce the risk of production issues. Improve your inventory tracking and delivery processes so all your employees receive the same information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Promote Holiday Material Beforehand<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing in the marketing rulebooks that says you have to promote your Christmas items after Thanksgiving. The truth of the matter is, many businesses start working on their holiday material in the summer. While it shouldn&#8217;t be your main focus in October, it&#8217;s still a good idea to introduce your products beforehand.<\/p>\n<p>Case in point, print-on-demand items. Let your clients know about holiday shirts, mugs, and other materials around mid-October. This allows them to ponder the items and purchase them ahead of time for gifts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stock up on Extra Inventory<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Supply chain issues of the COVID pandemic have taught small businesses to stock up on material and inventory. After all, it&#8217;s unknown when the next shipments will arrive. Generally, it&#8217;s best to bring in extra inventory toward the end of summer. This gives manufacturers time to produce and ship the products in a calm environment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Go Overboard<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t go overboard with your holiday items. In other words, avoid a complete shift to related products. There are still customers who need to purchase your non-holiday items. Make sure you introduce some of those along with the celebration-themed items.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Remain Calm<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Your employees remain calm and productive if you do the same. On the other hand, if you appear tense, snap at your employees, and demand they work harder, then your workers are going to feel the pressure. In turn, there&#8217;s a likelihood your productivity goes down during the height of the season.<\/p>\n<p>No matter how crazy things get, you need to stay calm. Your employees look at you for guidance. If they see how steady you are at the helm, then they&#8217;ll feel like everything is okay. Should you start to feel pressure, step away from your desk into another environment. Breathe and meditate to cool down your anxiety.<\/p>\n<p>These suggestions aren&#8217;t the only ones to consider your small business ready for the holidays. Nevertheless, they&#8217;re a start to keep you and your employees happy and productive during a hectic time. Make sure you implement them in small groups to attain achievable and measurable goals.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The holiday season is upon us.
