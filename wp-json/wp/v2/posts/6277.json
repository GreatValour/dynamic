Almost all of your customers will carry a debit or credit card, but only <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of them will have enough cash for the purchase. If you want to grow your business, it&#8217;s time you set up credit card processing to accept digital payments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not sure which credit card processing solutions are the best for you? Here&#8217;s what you need to know:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Online Processing System \u2013<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If all your business is done via a website, there&#8217;s no need for a physical credit card processing system. You can set up an online processing system to handle all your web-based orders easily. However, be warned: the private information of your clients is stored in a database that is easily hackable if you don&#8217;t have proper security measures. You&#8217;ll need to beef up security A LOT more than you would with an offline processing system. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Mobile Terminals \u2013<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For those who want versatility, the mobile terminal is a good option. It&#8217;s connected to your credit card processing software via a wireless network, so you can move it around your shop or restaurant and accept payments at tables, for example. If your business is outside or moves around a lot (like a farmer&#8217;s market stand or food truck), this is a good option to consider thanks to its portability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Wired Terminals \u2013<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you&#8217;re looking for reliability, nothing beats a wired terminal. The terminal stays by your cash register, where it&#8217;s connected to your landline\/Ethernet cable for a faster link to the credit card processing software. It&#8217;s the most reliable solution, if not the most versatile. You won&#8217;t be able to move the terminal, so all payments HAVE to be processed in the same place. However, the good news is that a lot of credit card processing solutions providers will give you a free terminal when you sign up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Point-of-Sale Processing \u2013 <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is essentially a cloud-based payment processing system that allows you to accept payments anywhere and at any time, provided you have internet access. The POS system is usually installed on a smartphone or tablet, and it&#8217;s connected via the internet to the software and system. The POS system also comes with a credit card reader that will access the data on the card, input it into the system, and process the transaction. The downside of a cloud-based solution is that it can be problematic if your internet connection isn&#8217;t reliable. Unless you find a vendor that provides offline solutions, you may end up paying a small fortune in data plans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each of these credit card processing solutions has its pros and cons. It&#8217;s up to you to determine which is best for your type of business and products and find the vendor to provide you the services you need!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The day of cash is in the past, and credit cards are now king.
