Their parents owed money on the home they lived in. They took out student loans to attend college. They are indebted to dealerships for their cars and banks for their homes. Most people have their debt under control, but you\u2019d be amazed by how quickly it can get out of hand. In the space of weeks, your debt can go from being a normal part of life to an overwhelming financial burden.<br \/>\nHere are a few ways debt can ruin your life if you\u2019re not careful:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You won\u2019t be able to buy the things you need.<\/strong> This goes well beyond just doing the weekly grocery shopping or furnishing your home. You won\u2019t be able to buy or lease a nice car because your credit score is terrible. You may not be able to save up enough to put a down payment on a house because every spare penny is going into repaying your loans.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your career can be affected negatively.<\/strong> Did you know that your professional license can be taken away if you don\u2019t repay student loans? If you default on student loans, you may end up losing the license you\u2019ve worked so hard for. But the effects don\u2019t stop there! If you are suffering under the crushing burden of debt, you may be forced to take whatever jobs you can get just to make ends meet. You may not be able to quit a terrible job because you\u2019re living from paycheck to paycheck, and you certainly won\u2019t be able to branch out and try to achieve your dreams. Your debt will trap you in your career.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You may never be free of the financial burden.<\/strong> There is only one way to make debt disappear: pay the money you owe. If for any number of reasons(health reasons, financial difficulties, etc.), you are unable to make payments, the debt will only grow. It will continue to grow with every passing month and year until it reaches an astronomical amount that will follow you for the rest of your life.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your income won\u2019t go as far.<\/strong> Did you know that the federal government is legally allowed to withhold 15% of your income in order to repay student loans? Your income tax refund can also be seized in payment of your debts if you have defaulted on your loans. All of the hard hours of work you put in won\u2019t go as far because a significant chunk of your income is going to pay off your debt.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As you can see, debt is no joke! It\u2019s in your best interest to avoid it at all costs or find a way to get out from under the burden of debt as soon as possible.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For many Americans, debt is something they have lived with since they can remember.
