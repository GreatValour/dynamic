Since your POS system is a major point of contact between your staff and your clients, it\u2019s important to keep it clean. Here are some important tips to effectively cleaning your credit card and point of sale system. By keeping your <a href=\"https:\/\/dynamicmerchantsolutions.com\/pos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">POS system<\/a> clean, you can rest assured your business will continue to thrive during this challenging time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Ensure All Equipment is Off Before Cleaning<\/strong><br \/>\nBefore you attempt to clean any electronic equipment, make sure everything is turned off. It will be easier to clean your equipment when it\u2019s unplugged. Remove the system entirely to clean the surfaces beneath and behind your POS. There\u2019s always a slight danger when cleaning around electronics and cables. Keeping surge protectors and cables unplugged will reduce the risk of electrocution or damage to your equipment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Avoid Harsh Chemicals<\/strong><br \/>\nIt\u2019s never a good idea to use harsh chemicals when cleaning your credit card system. These chemicals can cause harm to your electronics and are hazardous to breathe in. Most of the time, no cleaning products are needed to clean a credit card system properly. Simply wiping the surface with a dry cloth will remove any surface dust or particles.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Use a Microfiber Cloth<\/strong><br \/>\nThe best material to use when cleaning a POS system is a microfiber cloth. Paper towels may tear, leaving fragments of material behind. Microfiber cloths are inexpensive and reusable too. For best results, apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol to the fabric before cleaning surfaces. Microfiber cloths are easy to wash too. Microfiber material design is engineered to capture even the smallest particles, making them perfect for cleaning high-traffic areas like the space around your POS system.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Invest in Protective Covers<\/strong><br \/>\nIt\u2019s possible to install plastic protective covers over your POS equipment. This way, you need to clean the surfaces and not all the equipment. These covers can be found online and are available from a variety of providers. Remove these covers after every shift and replace them to help reduce the spread of Covid-19. As businesses continue to follow state and federal safety guidelines going into 2021, simple solutions like plastic covers for your credit card system will save you a lot of time and money in the long run.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Disinfecting Your POS System<\/strong><br \/>\nThere are specialty cleaners on the market specifically designed to clean electronics like credit card systems. Visit a local computer store and ask experts for advice on these products. To disinfect your POS system, use alcohol-based cleaners applied to a microfiber cloth, not the electronics. Alcohol will evaporate quickly, ensuring no damage is done to your equipment. Also, there\u2019s less of the lingering odor with alcohol than you might get from other cleaners.<\/p>\n<p>*Never apply water or spray cleaners directly onto electronics when cleaning. Computer monitors are especially vulnerable to moisture. If your equipment becomes damaged due to moisture, contact a trusted local professional to look at the problem immediately.<\/p>\n<p>While 2021 marks a potentially better year for businesses, many will continue to work hard to provide safer environments for everyone. Minimizing the spread of respiratory illnesses like <a href=\"https:\/\/dynamicmerchantsolutions.com\/managing-disputes-covid-19\/\">Covid-19<\/a> will likely remain a significant component to running a successful business. Consider these tips to keep your business clean and in compliance with state and federal guidelines.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Considering the new normal in light of the pandemic, businesses are under more pressure than ever to maintain a safe and healthy environment for both customers and employees.
