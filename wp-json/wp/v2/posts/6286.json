That way you avoid mistakes and you don&#8217;t end up with a lot of unexpected fees, problems, and charges. Here are 10 things you really need to know, so you&#8217;ll be ready to get started.<\/p>\n<p>1. You need to have underwriting so you can reduce your level of risk, in case a mistake is made by your company or its employees.<\/p>\n<p>2. A business bank account is usually going to be a requirement, so you&#8217;ll need to get one even if you are a very small (including just one person) business.<\/p>\n<p>3. Your business will need to have a license in the vast majority of instances, because most businesses are required to be licensed by the state or other entity.<\/p>\n<p>4. You may be able to complete a merchant account application online, so you can get started faster and handle things from your business or even your home.<\/p>\n<p>5. You might need separate merchant accounts if you are taking different types of payments, because not all merchant accounts allow for all types of payment options.<\/p>\n<p>6. Your processing volume will determine the supporting documents you need, and doing a lot of business can mean more proof of what you do and how you do it.<\/p>\n<p>7. It may take only one business day to get your merchant account up and running, so you can have your account ready to go without a lot of delays.<\/p>\n<p>8. If you have a merchant account for your storefront you can use it online, as well, and that means you don&#8217;t need to start up another account.<\/p>\n<p>9. The fees you pay and the processing times can vary, so check around and ask plenty of questions before you start your merchant account.<\/p>\n<p>10. You need to understand PCI compliance to meet data security standards, in order to protect your company and its customers.<br \/>\nReady to learn more and get started with a merchant account for your business?
